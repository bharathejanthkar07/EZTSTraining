'''In the enchanted land of Numeria, Alice is on a quest to find the legendary 
Prime Key to unlock the ancient Vault of Secrets. The vault's guardian, an 
ancient sphinx, presents a multi-step puzzle that Alice must solve to obtain the 
Prime Key.
The puzzle consists of multiple levels, each requiring Alice to solve a different 
challenge involving prime numbers. To progress through each level, Alice must 
perform the following tasks:
Level 1: Find the smallest prime number larger than a given integer N.
Level 2: Calculate the sum of all prime numbers between N and the smallest 
prime number larger than N.
Level 3: Determine if the product of the smallest prime number larger than N
and the next immediate prime number is also a prime.
To complete the puzzle and retrieve the Prime Key, Alice must solve these 
challenges in sequence for a given integer N.
Your task is to write a function that takes an integer N and returns a tuple 
containing the following:
- The smallest prime number larger than N (Level 1 result).
- The sum of all prime numbers between N and the smallest prime number 
larger than N (Level 2 result).
- A boolean indicating whether the product of the smallest prime number 
larger than N and the next immediate prime number is prime (Level 3 result).
Help Alice navigate through the levels, solve the puzzle, and obtain the Prime 
Key to unlock the Vault of Secrets'''
